/*******************************************************************************************
I used the Big Three in the Hand class because the Hand class contain a Card pointer to cards, 
which stores the array of cards in a player's hand. As the game progresses, the number of cards
in each player's hand will increase and decrease. Dynamic memory exists in the Hand class. Some 
cards will stay the same and some cards will be removed or added after each turn. Also, I have 
to prevent changes to the hand I'm copying data from. This is why the CC, AOO, and the Const 
keyword are necessary. In order to make sure there are no memory leaks, a destructor must be 
called. Thus, the Big Three is required in the Hand class.

Private variables are vital to encapsulation. This way, they canâ€™t be modified outside of the class. 
Accessors are important because during every turn, the program needs to know how many cards are left 
in both players' hands, as well as the array of cards in both players' hands. Mutators help set the value 
of the objects inside the Hand class and they are also vital to encapsulation, which avoids broken code.
