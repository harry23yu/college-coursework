During fall 2022, I took CS162, Intro to Computer Science II. I did a variety of assignments and labs as part of my coursework. All of the code I wrote is in C++. The assignments included creating a Hunt the Wumpus Game and a Go Fish game. The labs included creating a program that would print out different sizes of fractals based on user input.
