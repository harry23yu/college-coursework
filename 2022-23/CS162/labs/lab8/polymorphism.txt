Step 1

1. I am going to make the area() function in shape polymorphic.
2. Use references or pointers to make the function polymorphic.
3. Yes, it can be a pure virtual function.
4. The shape class is now the abstract base class.
5. I don't need destructors in this scneario because no dynamic memory is allowed.

Step 2

1. The size of the vector is 10 because there are 10 different shapes. To check 
the size of the vector, use the size() function. The capacity of the vector is 16. 
To check the capacity of the vector, use the capacity() function.
2. My program doesn't have memory leaks. I need to manually free the memory because 
the shapes are dynamically allocated.
