1. One of the values of the sorted array was 0. I used the print command to find the 
logic error.
2. I ran through the code and found out 93, the largest number, wasn't being printed 
orginally. I did many tests, and I removed the = sign on j in line 31. That fixed the 
problem, and the array is printed in order, with the number 93.
