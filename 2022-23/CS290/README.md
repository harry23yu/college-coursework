During spring 2023, I took CS290, Web Development. I did 8 assignments as part of my coursework, including creating a "Magic Math" game (HW6) where users attempt to reach a certain number by evaluating three addition, subtraction, and/or multiplication equations using four randomly chosen integers from 0 to 10.

Also, for the songs database assignment (HW8), MongoDB is required to run the backend. This means that searching, updating, deleting, adding, and listing songs won't work without MongoDB.
